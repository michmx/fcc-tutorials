# Contributing

[FCC Software][fcc-software] tutorials, as well as the whole [Key4hep][key4hep]
ecosystem, is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds:

* New lessons;
* Fixes to existing material;
* Bug reports; and
* Reviews of proposed changes.

By contributing, you are agreeing that we may redistribute your work under
[these licenses][license].
You also agree to abide by our [contributor code of conduct][conduct].


## Getting Started

1. We use the [fork and pull][gh-fork-pull] model to manage changes.
   GitHub also provides more information about [forking a repository][gh-fork]
   and [making a Pull Request][gh-pull] on their website.

2. For our lessons, you should branch from and submit pull requests against
   the `main` branch.

3. When editing lesson pages, you need to only commit changes to the Markdown
   source files.

4. To build the tutorials please follow the
   [instructions](#building-the-tutorials).

5. If you're looking for things to work on, please see
   [the list of issues for this repository][issues]. Comments on issues and
   reviews of pull requests are equally welcome.


## Building the tutorials

### Requirements

Make sure you have `venv` (virtual environment) in your working directory. It
can be created with the following command:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate it in your shell and install the requirements, which are gathered in a
file provided by the repository.
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
After sourcing, your shell prompt will be augmented by the `(venv)` prefix, e.g.
```
(venv) mylaptop:~/fcc/fcc-tutorials
```

:::{admonition} Building `fcc-tutorials` in the Key4hep stack
:class: callout dropdown

In case you are editing the tutorials using the FCC Software (Key4hep) stack, it
is necessary to clear the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable after sourcing of
the stack
```bash
source /cvmfs/fcc.cern.ch/sw/latest/setup.sh
unset PYTHONPATH
```

Using of the FCCSW stack might also be needed in cases when the Python provided
by your OS is too old.
:::

### Building

The pages are built with [Jupyter Book 2](https://next.jupyterbook.org/),
which is based on the [MyST-MD](https://mystmd.org/) engine and needs
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or newer) available in your `PATH`.
The static HTML site is generated with
```bash
jupyter book build --html
```
and lands in the `_build/html` directory.

### Browsing the result

The quickest way to preview your changes is the live-reloading development
server, which rebuilds the pages every time a Markdown file is saved:
```bash
jupyter book start
```

You should be able to see your local version by opening a web-browser and
navigating to the address printed in the terminal (by default
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
